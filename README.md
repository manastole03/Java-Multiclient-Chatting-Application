# Java-Multiclient-Chatting-Application


Due to my interest in the Java programming language, I came up with this idea and implemented it in a good programmatical manner.
This is a Multi-Client Chatting application where client Handler classes interact with each other using a server class.

Technologies Used: Core Java, Java Swing, Java AWT, and Socket Programming
